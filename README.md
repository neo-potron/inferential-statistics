# Inferential Statistics â€“ Numerical Simulations in Python

This project explores key concepts in inferential statistics through simulations and visualizations implemented in Python. It covers the law of large numbers, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing, both analytically and on real-world data.

## Features

- Simulation of the Law of Large Numbers
- Numerical construction of sampling distributions
- Confidence intervals (Gaussian and Student's t-distribution)
- Analysis of real-world height data (parent-child dataset)
- Visualization of :
  - Histograms and boxplots
  - Sampling means and intervals
  - p-values and hypothesis test results
- Comparison with theoretical statistical models

## Requirements

- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- scipy  
- jupyter (optional, for notebooks)

Install all dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
